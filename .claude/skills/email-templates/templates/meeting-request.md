# Meeting Request Template

## Purpose

Schedule time efficiently by demonstrating value upfront. The recipient should know exactly why meeting is worth their time.

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{recipient_name}}` | First name | "Priya" |
| `{{context}}` | Why meeting makes sense | "Based on our Slack thread about rate limiting" |
| `{{topic}}` | Meeting subject | "API integration" |
| `{{duration}}` | Time commitment | "30 min" |
| `{{agenda_items}}` | Specific topics (bulleted) | Review limits, discuss patterns, agree on solution |
| `{{time_options}}` | 3 specific time slots | Tuesday 2 PM, Wednesday 10 AM, Thursday 3 PM |
| `{{sender_name}}` | Your name | "Alex" |

## Template

Subject: {{duration}} sync on {{topic}} - {{number}} time options

Hi {{recipient_name}},

{{context}}

Proposed agenda ({{duration}}):
{{agenda_items}}

Would any of these work?
{{time_options}}

{{sender_name}}

## Example Filled

**Subject:** 30-min sync on API integration - 3 time options

Hi Priya,

Based on our Slack thread about the rate limiting issue, I think we'd resolve this faster in a quick call.

Proposed agenda (30 min):
- Review current rate limits (5 min)
- Discuss your usage patterns (10 min)
- Agree on solution approach (15 min)

Would any of these work?
- Tuesday 2-2:30 PM EST
- Wednesday 10-10:30 AM EST
- Thursday 3-3:30 PM EST

## Best Practices

| Practice | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Include specific agenda | Shows you've prepared, respects their time |
| Offer 3 time options minimum | Increases chance of fit |
| State duration clearly | Sets expectations, shows respect |
| Include time zone | Prevents confusion, especially remote |
| Time-boxed agenda items | Demonstrates efficiency |

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Instead |
|---------|---------|---------|
| "Let's hop on a call" | Vague, no agenda | Specific purpose with agenda |
| "When are you free?" | Puts burden on them | Offer specific times |
| "Quick sync" (no time) | Unclear commitment | State exact duration |
| Back-to-back requests | Assumes first time works | Offer alternatives upfront |
